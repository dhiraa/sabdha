### Documentation

- Sphinix uses [restructuredText](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html)

**Note**:
- Currently generated HTML files are commited to the `docs` folder, since we couldn't not find a way to host directly with git-hub pages 
- An `Jekyll` redirective is placed in [`index.html`](index.html) to the build [index](build/html/index.html) file.
